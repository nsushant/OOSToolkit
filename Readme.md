### On Orbit Servicing Toolkit

## Project Aims 

To create a simulation based toolkit that integrates ideas from OR and Physics to enable the study and planning of on-orbit servicing missions. The currently available components include ;- 

+ An N-body simulation that evolves the orbits of a walker delta constellation and a service depot forwards in time. 

+ Plotting scripts in python that allow you to visualize initial conditions, view orbits and animate the motions of constellation satellites 

+ A lambert solver that lets you optimize trajectories for service shuttles based on servicing demands. 

Upcoming features include;- 

+ Optimization routines that let you construct both an optimal schedule and an optimal inventory management system.
